# Intro

Solution for VueJS exercise done by Sergio Mart√≠n (sermmor). You could read the original version (without solution) in Lemoncode repository https://github.com/Lemoncode/vuejs-excercise

The exercise consists in an application that displays a list of github members that
belongs to an organization (in the starting excercise is hardcoded to _lemoncode_), and 
we will add an input element to let the user choose another organization to query.
